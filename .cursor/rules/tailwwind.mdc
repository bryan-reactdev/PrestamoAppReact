The user has a specific way of ordering tailwind classes. They follow roughly the following order:

## Order
1. Position related eg. absolute, relative
2. Size eg. width, height
3. Display eg. flex
4. Alignment eg. justify-center, items-center
5. Spacing eg. padding, margin
6. Borders eg. border-1 rounded-lg
7. Text eg. font-bold, but at last before the next 'section' colors like text-white
8. Colors eg. bg-red-500
9. Transitions, etc,
And at the last z-index.

Some of the attributes are missing from this rough order list but this should give you a general idea.
